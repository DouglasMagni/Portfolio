                    <p>
                        I'm Douglas Post, a recent graduate from a tech program in Auckland, known as Dev Academy Aotearoa. At Dev Academy, I acquired skills in building fullstack software applications in an Agile environment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My professional journey includes 5 years as a support analyst in Brazil, where I assisted ERP users, followed by 5 months as a help desk technician in Auckland, gaining valuable local IT experience. I'm now transitioning into software development, with a keen interest in server-side work and data analysis.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Upon arriving in New Zealand 6 years ago on a working holiday visa, I had the opportunity to work and travel across the country. After that great experience, my partner and I decided to settle here and make Aotearoa our new home. To secure residency, I embarked on a career in construction and also took this period to improve my language skills. This journey included managing small teams, which taught me the importance of teamwork and effective communication.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In my free time, I enjoy playing football, staying active with workouts, and exploring nature through hiking and cycling. I also have a passion for cooking, particularly barbecue.
                    </p>
                    <p>Let's connect and explore how I can contribute to your team!</p>

                        I made this project in the second week of the bootcamp, after learning about React, because I felt that I needed to improve my abilities in React. So this is my very first project. I wanted to do something simple and be able to finish it in the same weekend, as the next week I would learn something else.

                    <h2>MoviesLib</h2>

                    <p>
                        This project, named 'MoviesLib,' originated during the third week of the Dev Academy boot camp. After the boot camp concluded, I seized the opportunity to further develop it, adding additional styling and features to refine it into a showcase piece for my portfolio.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        MoviesLib is a project that allowed me to hone my front-end skills while practicing API consumption. Specifically, it interfaces with the TMDB (The Movie Database) API to fetch movie data dynamically. Through this project, I aimed to reinforce my understanding of API integration and enhance my proficiency in front-end development.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I invite you to explore MoviesLib and experience the culmination of my efforts in this endeavor.

                    <p>The Tradie Tracker App is a web application designed to streamline job management for tradespeople. It allows users to efficiently manage their projects, clients, and tasks in one centralized platform.</p>
                    <p>I brought up this idea from a real-world problem identified during a conversation with a friend of mine who lives in Sydney and manages his jobs and employees using Excel tables. After a long conversation, we defined a product that would meet his demands, and I decided to suggest that idea to my colleagues, who liked it and embarked on this project with me. It's something that I am proud of.</p>
